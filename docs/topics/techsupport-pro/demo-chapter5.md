# Chapter 5: Supervision & Fault Tolerance

<!--
TOC: Tutorial: TechSupport Pro > Chapter 5: Supervision & Fault Tolerance
Audience: All users
Duration: 55 minutes
Prerequisites: Chapter 4 completed

## Purpose

Implement comprehensive supervision trees and fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure system resilience and automatic recovery.

## Plan

1. **Supervision architecture** - Designing fault-tolerant process hierarchies
2. **Error handling strategies** - Process restart and recovery policies
3. **Health monitoring** - System health checks and alerting
4. **Graceful degradation** - Maintaining service during failures
5. **Testing resilience** - Chaos testing and failure simulation

This chapter shows how to build production-ready systems that can handle failures gracefully.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Supervisor process implementation
- Process linking and monitoring strategies
- Automatic restart policies and backoff
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Circuit breaker patterns for external services
