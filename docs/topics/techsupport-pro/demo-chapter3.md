## Purpose

Implement agent specialization with dedicated agents for sales, technical support, and billing, including delegation and routing.

## Plan

1. **Specialist agent design** - Creating domain-specific agents
2. **Router agent implementation** - Intelligent request classification
3. **Delegation configuration** - Setting up agent handoffs
4. **Specialized tools** - Domain-specific tool integration
5. **Conversation continuity** - Maintaining context across agent switches

This chapter shows how to build sophisticated multi-agent systems with specialization and delegation.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Sales, technical, and billing agent configurations
- Router agent with classification logic
- Delegation rules and handoff patterns
- Specialized tool sets for each domain
- Context preservation across agent transitions
