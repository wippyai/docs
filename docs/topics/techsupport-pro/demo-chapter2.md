## Purpose

Extend the basic chat interface with knowledge base integration, enabling the agent to search and reference support documentation.

## Plan

2. **Search tool implementation** - Full-text and semantic search
3. **Agent tool integration** - Connecting search to the support agent
4. **Result presentation** - Formatting search results for users
5. **Testing and validation** - Verifying knowledge base accuracy

This chapter demonstrates how to make agents truly useful by connecting them to organizational knowledge.

<!--
