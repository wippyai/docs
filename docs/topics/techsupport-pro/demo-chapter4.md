## Purpose

Add background task processing for email notifications, report generation, and other asynchronous operations using Wippy's actor model.

## Plan

1. **Task queue architecture** - Background job processing system
2. **Email notification system** - Automated customer communications
3. **Report generation** - Periodic analytics and summaries
4. **Process supervision** - Ensuring background tasks run reliably
5. **Monitoring and alerting** - Tracking background job health

This chapter demonstrates how to build robust asynchronous systems using Wippy's process model.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Background task queue with worker processes
- Email service integration and templates
- Automated report generation processes
- Supervisor processes for task reliability
- Monitoring and alerting for background jobs
