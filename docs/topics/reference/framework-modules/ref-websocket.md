## Purpose

Complete reference for the websocket module, covering client-side WebSocket implementation for establishing connections, sending/receiving messages, and managing connection lifecycles with coroutine integration.

## Content Plan

This reference will include:

1. **Connection Management**
   - `websocket.connect()` - establishing WebSocket connections
   - Connection configuration and options
   - Authentication and handshake handling
   - Connection lifecycle and state management

2. **Message Operations**
   - `send()`, `receive()` - message transmission
   - Text and binary message handling
   - Message framing and protocol compliance
   - Ping/pong and keepalive mechanisms

3. **Coroutine Integration**
   - Async message handling patterns
   - Channel-based communication
   - Concurrent connection management
   - Event loop integration

4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Connection error detection and handling
   - Automatic reconnection strategies
   - Graceful shutdown and cleanup
   - Network failure recovery

## Implementation Details

### Connection APIs:
