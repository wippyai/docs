## Purpose

Complete reference for the system module, which provides access to Go runtime information, system monitoring, memory management, and performance metrics.

## Content Plan

This reference will include:

1. **Runtime Information**
   - `system.info()` - system and runtime details
   - Go version, OS, architecture information
   - Process identification and metadata
   - System resource limits and capabilities

2. **Memory Management**
   - `system.memory()` - memory statistics and usage
   - Garbage collection control and monitoring
   - Memory allocation patterns and optimization
   - Heap analysis and profiling support

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - `system.goroutines()` - goroutine monitoring
   - CPU usage and scheduling information
   - I/O statistics and network metrics
   - Performance profiling integration

4. **System Control**
   - Garbage collection triggering
   - Runtime parameter adjustment
   - Resource limit management
   - Shutdown and cleanup coordination

## Implementation Details

### System APIs to Document:
