## Purpose

Complete reference for the ctx module, which provides the interface for interacting with Wippy's shared context system, enabling communication and data sharing between components.

## Content Plan

This reference will cover:

1. **Context Operations**
   - `ctx.get()`, `ctx.set()`, `ctx.delete()`
   - Context scoping and namespaces
   - Data serialization and type handling
   - Atomic operations and transactions

2. **Shared State Management**
   - Process-local vs global context
   - Context inheritance and propagation
   - Cleanup and garbage collection
   - Memory management strategies

3. **Integration Patterns**
   - Component communication through context
   - Configuration sharing and distribution
   - Event coordination and signaling
   - Resource sharing and pooling

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions to Document:
- Context CRUD operations with examples
- Namespace management and isolation
- Data type handling and serialization
- Error conditions and recovery

### Advanced Features:
- Context watchers and notifications
- Distributed context synchronization
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security and access control

### Usage Patterns:
- Inter-component communication
- Configuration distribution
- Resource coordination
- State synchronization across processes
