## Purpose

Comprehensive reference for the sql.semantic module, which extends the SQL module with vector similarity search, full-text search, and hybrid approaches for AI-powered document and semantic search capabilities.

## Content Plan

This reference will cover:

1. **Vector Search Operations**
   - Vector embedding storage and indexing
   - Similarity search algorithms and metrics
   - Vector database integration patterns
   - Performance optimization for large datasets

2. **Full-Text Search Integration**
   - Text indexing and tokenization
   - Search ranking and relevance scoring
   - Query expansion and fuzzy matching
   - Multi-language support and stemming

3. **Hybrid Search Approaches**
   - Combining vector and text search
   - Result fusion and ranking strategies
   - Query planning and optimization
   - Cache management and performance tuning

4. **AI Integration Patterns**
   - Embedding generation and management
   - Model integration and versioning
   - Real-time vs batch indexing
   - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) support
