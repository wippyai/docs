## Purpose

Complete reference for Wippy's Agent API, covering agent creation, tool integration, conversation management, and the agent framework's programmatic interface.

## Content Plan

This reference will document:

1. **Agent Creation and Configuration**
   - Programmatic agent definition and instantiation
   - Dynamic configuration and runtime modification
   - Agent inheritance and trait composition
   - Lifecycle management and resource cleanup

2. **Tool Integration and Management**
   - Tool registration and discovery
   - Function calling and result handling
   - Tool delegation and routing
   - Custom tool development patterns

3. **Conversation and Memory APIs**
   - Conversation state management
   - Memory persistence and retrieval
   - Context window optimization
   - History pruning and archival

4. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Multi-agent coordination patterns
   - Message routing between agents
   - Delegation and handoff mechanisms
   - Agent supervision and monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Agent Framework Components:
- **Agent Runtime**: Execution environment and lifecycle
- **Tool System**: Registration, discovery, execution
- **Memory Management**: Persistence, retrieval, optimization
- **Orchestration Layer**: Multi-agent coordination

### API Structure:
- **Core Agent APIs**: Creation, configuration, execution
- **Tool Integration**: Registration, calling, result handling
- **Memory Operations**: Storage, retrieval, management
- **Coordination APIs**: Agent-to-agent communication

### Programming Interface:
- Function signatures and type definitions
- Async/await patterns and error handling
- Resource management and cleanup
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Integration with process system

### Advanced Features:
- Custom agent types and behaviors
- Plugin architecture for extensions
- Real-time configuration updates
- Distributed agent coordination
- Debugging and introspection tools
