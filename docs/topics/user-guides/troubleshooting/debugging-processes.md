## Purpose

Learn how to debug process-related issues including message flow, supervision problems, and performance bottlenecks.

## Plan

1. **Process inspection** - Viewing process state and statistics
2. **Message tracing** - Following message flow between processes
3. **Supervision debugging** - Understanding process failures and restarts
4. **Deadlock detection** - Identifying and resolving deadlocks
5. **Performance profiling** - Process-level performance analysis

This guide provides tools and techniques for debugging complex process interactions.
