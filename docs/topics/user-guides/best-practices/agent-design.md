## Purpose

Best practices for designing effective AI agents including prompt engineering, tool integration, and behavior optimization.

## Plan

1. **Prompt engineering** - Writing effective prompts and using traits
2. **Tool design** - Creating useful, reliable tools for agents
3. **Behavior consistency** - Ensuring predictable agent responses
4. **Context management** - Handling conversation state and memory
5. **Performance optimization** - Minimizing tokens and response time

This guide helps create agents that are useful, reliable, and efficient.
