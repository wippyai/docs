## Purpose

Build a complete RESTful API with CRUD operations, authentication, and agent integration to demonstrate Wippy's web capabilities.

## Plan

1. **API architecture** - Service, router, and endpoint organization
2. **Resource endpoints** - CRUD operations for a blog API
3. **Authentication middleware** - JWT-based API security
4. **Agent integration** - AI-powered content generation endpoints
5. **Testing and validation** - API testing and error handling

This hands-on demo creates a realistic API that showcases Wippy's HTTP capabilities and AI integration.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Complete blog API with posts, comments, users
- HTTP service and router configuration
- CRUD endpoint implementations
- JWT authentication middleware
- Agent-powered content generation
- Input validation and error handling
- API testing strategies
