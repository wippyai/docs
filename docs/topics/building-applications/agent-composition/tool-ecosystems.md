## Purpose

Learn how to build comprehensive tool ecosystems that can be shared across agents and extended by the community.

## Plan

1. **Tool architecture** - Designing reusable, composable tools
2. **Tool libraries** - Organizing tools into coherent packages
3. **Tool discovery** - Making tools findable and usable
4. **Tool composition** - Combining tools for complex operations
5. **Community patterns** - Sharing and extending tool ecosystems

This guide demonstrates how to create rich tool ecosystems that enhance agent capabilities across applications.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Tool registry organization and namespacing
- Tool interface design and standards
- Tool documentation and discovery mechanisms
- Tool composition and chaining patterns
- Namespace wildcards for tool inclusion
- Community tool sharing and contribution patterns
