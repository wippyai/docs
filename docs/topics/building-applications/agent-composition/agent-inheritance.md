## Purpose

Master Wippy's agent inheritance system for building hierarchical agent architectures with shared capabilities and specialized behaviors.

## Plan

1. **Inheritance concepts** - How agents inherit from parent agents
2. **Capability composition** - Combining prompts, traits, tools, and memory
3. **Inheritance hierarchies** - Multi-level inheritance patterns
4. **Override strategies** - Customizing inherited behavior
5. **Best practices** - Designing maintainable agent families

This guide shows how to build scalable agent architectures through inheritance and composition.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- inherit field configuration in agent definitions
- Prompt combination and trait merging rules
- Tool and memory inheritance patterns
- Multi-level inheritance chains
- Circular inheritance detection
- Override patterns and specialization strategies
