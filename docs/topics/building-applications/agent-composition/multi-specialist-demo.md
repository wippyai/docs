## Purpose

Build a comprehensive multi-agent support system with specialized agents for sales, technical support, and billing, demonstrating advanced agent composition.

## Plan

1. **System architecture** - Router agent and specialist agent design
2. **Agent specialization** - Sales, technical, and billing agent implementations
3. **Delegation flows** - Intelligent routing and handoffs
4. **Shared tools** - Common tools across specialist agents
5. **Performance monitoring** - Multi-agent system observability

This advanced demo showcases sophisticated agent architectures for real-world business applications.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Router agent with intelligent classification
- Specialized agents with domain-specific capabilities
- Delegation and handoff patterns
- Shared tool library and agent-specific tools
- Conversation state management across agents
- System monitoring and performance optimization
