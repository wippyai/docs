## Purpose

Learn how to build delegation systems where agents can route tasks to specialized agents based on context and expertise.

## Plan

1. **Delegation architecture** - Router agents and specialist agents
2. **Delegation rules** - Defining when and how to delegate
3. **Task routing** - Message passing between agents
4. **Context preservation** - Maintaining conversation state across delegation
5. **Escalation patterns** - Handling complex delegation chains

This guide demonstrates how to create intelligent agent networks that can solve complex problems through specialization.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- delegate field configuration in agent definitions
- Delegation rule design and implementation
- Agent-to-agent message passing patterns
- Context sharing and conversation continuity
- Delegation tool creation and usage
- Multi-level delegation and escalation flows
