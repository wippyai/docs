## Purpose

Design and implement complex workflows involving multiple agents working together to accomplish sophisticated tasks.

## Plan

1. **Workflow architecture** - Orchestrating agent interactions
2. **Message choreography** - Coordinating agent communication
3. **State management** - Tracking workflow progress and data
4. **Error handling** - Managing failures in multi-agent systems
5. **Performance optimization** - Parallel execution and load balancing

This guide shows how to build sophisticated AI systems that leverage multiple specialized agents.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Workflow orchestration patterns
- Agent communication protocols
- Shared state management across agents
- Error recovery and retry strategies
- Parallel agent execution patterns
- Workflow monitoring and debugging
