## Purpose

Master Wippy's key-value storage systems for caching, session management, and high-performance data access patterns.

## Plan

1. **Store types** - Memory stores and persistent storage options
2. **Caching patterns** - Application-level caching strategies
3. **Session management** - User session storage and TTL handling
4. **Performance optimization** - Efficient key design and access patterns
5. **Data structures** - Storing complex data in key-value systems

This guide shows how to use key-value storage for performance and scalability in Wippy applications.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- store.memory configuration and usage
- TTL-based expiration and cleanup
- Session storage patterns for web applications
- Key naming conventions and organization
- JSON serialization for complex data
- Performance monitoring and optimization
