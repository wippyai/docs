**Purpose:** Introduce the fundamental concepts that underpin Wippy framework - Actor Model, processes, agents, and configuration-driven development.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Actor Model Basics** - Processes, isolation, and message passing
2. **Process Lifecycle** - Creation, supervision, and termination
3. **AI Agent Concepts** - LLM integration, tools, and behaviors
4. **Registry System** - Configuration-driven component management
5. **Component Architecture** - How pieces fit together
6. **Key Terminology** - Essential vocabulary for Wippy development
7. **Mental Models** - How to think about concurrent AI applications

## Implementation Notes

- Use simple diagrams to illustrate actor model concepts
- Provide concrete analogies for abstract concepts (processes as workers, messages as memos)
- Include interactive examples that can be run immediately
- Create glossary of key terms with cross-references
- Show progression from simple process to AI-powered agent
- Include common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Add links to deeper exploration in later sections
