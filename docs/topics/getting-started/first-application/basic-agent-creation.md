## Purpose

Create your first AI agent using Wippy's configuration-driven agent framework, demonstrating how agents interact with processes.

## Plan

1. **Agent configuration** - Define agent in YAML with basic prompt
2. **Agent traits** - Apply conversational trait for natural interaction
3. **Process integration** - Connect agent to message-handling process
4. **Simple conversation** - Test agent responses to user input

This tutorial bridges the gap between Wippy's actor model and AI capabilities, showing how agents are processes with LLM-powered behavior.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- YAML agent definition with registry.entry
- Basic prompt engineering for agents
- Using built-in traits like "conversational"
- agent_gen1 library for running agents
- Connecting agents to the process messaging system
