## Purpose

Learn how to create your first Wippy process that demonstrates basic message passing and the actor model fundamentals.

## Plan

1. **Create a simple process** - Basic Lua process with run function
2. **Implement message handling** - Listen for messages and respond
3. **Process spawning** - Start the process and send it messages
4. **Testing the interaction** - Verify message passing works correctly

This tutorial introduces the core concept of processes in Wippy, showing how they communicate through message passing rather than shared state.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Basic process.lua structure
- Using process.listen() for message handling
- Spawning processes with process.spawn()
- Sending messages with process.send()
- Simple request-response pattern
