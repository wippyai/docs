**Purpose:** Learn how to create your first Wippy process that demonstrates basic message passing and the actor model fundamentals.

## Plan

This tutorial will cover:

1. **Process Structure** - Basic Lua process with run function
2. **Message Handling** - Listen for messages and respond appropriately
3. **Process Spawning** - Start the process and communicate with it
4. **Testing Interaction** - Verify message passing works correctly
5. **Understanding Output** - Interpreting process behavior and logs
6. **Common Patterns** - Basic request-response communication

## Implementation Notes

- Create basic process.lua file with proper structure
- Demonstrate process.listen() for topic-based message handling
- Show process.spawn() for creating new process instances
- Use process.send() for inter-process communication
- Include debugging tips and common error messages
- Provide complete working example with test commands
- Explain process lifecycle and cleanup
