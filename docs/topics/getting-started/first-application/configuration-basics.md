## Purpose

Understand Wippy's YAML-based configuration system and registry architecture for defining components and their relationships.

## Plan

1. **Registry concepts** - Namespaces, entries, and component identification
2. **YAML structure** - Standard format for component definitions
3. **Component types** - Overview of available component kinds
4. **Environment variables** - Configuration with runtime values
5. **Dependency management** - How components reference each other

This tutorial explains the foundation of Wippy's configuration-driven architecture that makes complex applications manageable.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- YAML file structure with version and namespace
- Registry entry format with kind and meta
- Common component types (process.lua, function.lua, agent.gen1)
- Environment variable interpolation
- Component references and lifecycle dependencies
