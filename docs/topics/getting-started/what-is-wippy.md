**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive introduction to Wippy framework, explaining its unique combination of Actor Model concurrency with AI agent development and when to use it.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Framework Definition** - What Wippy is and its core purpose
2. **Dual Architecture** - Go runtime + Lua framework components
3. **Actor Model Foundation** - Process-based concurrency and message passing
4. **AI Agent Integration** - LLM-powered agents within actor processes
5. **Unique Value Proposition** - What makes Wippy different
6. **Use Case Scenarios** - When Wippy is the right choice
7. **Ecosystem Overview** - Community, tools, and extensions

## Implementation Notes

- Include side-by-side comparison with traditional web frameworks
- Show simple code example demonstrating actor + agent integration
- Provide architecture diagram showing Go runtime executing Lua processes
- Add comparison table with other actor model frameworks (Erlang/OTP, Akka)
- Include real-world application examples and case studies
- Explain the benefits of Lua for rapid AI agent development
- Address common questions about performance and scalability
