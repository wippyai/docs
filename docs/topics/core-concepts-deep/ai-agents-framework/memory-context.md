## Purpose

Understand how agents maintain context, manage memory, and handle conversation state for consistent, personalized interactions.

## Plan

1. **Memory types** - Static knowledge vs. dynamic conversation state
2. **Context management** - Maintaining conversation history
3. **Memory configuration** - Files, registry entries, and inline memory
4. **State persistence** - Storing agent state across interactions
5. **Context limits** - Managing token limits and memory optimization

This guide explains how to build agents that remember and learn from interactions.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Agent memory field configuration
- Conversation history management
- Memory file references and content
- Context window management for LLMs
- State storage using Wippy's store modules
- Memory optimization strategies
