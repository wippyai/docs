**Purpose:** Master agent memory management including conversation context, persistent memory, and state handling for building sophisticated conversational agents.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Memory Types** - Static memory vs dynamic conversation context
2. **Context Management** - Conversation history and token limits
3. **Memory Configuration** - YAML-based memory definition and sources
4. **State Persistence** - Storing and retrieving agent state
5. **Memory Optimization** - Managing context size and relevance
6. **Cross-Session Memory** - Maintaining state across conversations
7. **Memory Security** - Access control and sensitive information handling

## Implementation Notes

- Show memory configuration in agent YAML definitions
- Demonstrate conversation context management and pruning
- Include memory storage backends and persistence options
- Provide context optimization strategies for token efficiency
- Show cross-session state management patterns
- Include memory access patterns and retrieval strategies
- Provide security guidelines for memory content and access
