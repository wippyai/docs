**Purpose:** Master prompt engineering in Wippy including trait composition, system message construction, and best practices for creating effective agent behaviors.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Prompt Architecture** - Base prompts vs trait prompts and composition
2. **Trait System** - Reusable behavior components and inheritance
3. **System Message Assembly** - How Wippy constructs final system messages
4. **Prompt Engineering** - Best practices for clear, effective instructions
5. **Trait Composition** - Combining multiple traits for complex behaviors
6. **Standard Traits** - Built-in traits and their applications
7. **Custom Trait Development** - Creating reusable prompt components

## Implementation Notes

- Show trait definition structure and prompt composition rules
- Demonstrate system message construction algorithm
- Include prompt engineering best practices and examples
- Provide trait library with common behavior patterns
- Show trait inheritance and composition patterns
- Include testing strategies for prompt effectiveness
- Provide debugging techniques for prompt-related issues
