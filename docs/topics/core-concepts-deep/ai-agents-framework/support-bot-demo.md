## Purpose

Build a complete customer support bot that demonstrates agent architecture, tool integration, and context management in a real-world scenario.

## Plan

1. **Bot architecture** - Agent configuration with support-specific traits
2. **Knowledge base tool** - Search functionality for support articles
3. **Ticket creation tool** - Integration with ticketing system
4. **Conversation flow** - Handling multi-turn support interactions
5. **Escalation patterns** - Transferring to human agents when needed

This hands-on demo shows how to build practical AI agents that can handle real customer support scenarios.

<!--
