## Purpose

Learn how to extend agent capabilities by integrating tools, enabling agents to perform actions beyond text generation.

## Plan

1. **Tool architecture** - How tools work with agents
2. **Built-in tools** - Wippy's standard tool library
3. **Custom tool creation** - Building domain-specific tools
4. **Tool calling flow** - Request, execution, and response cycle
5. **Error handling** - Managing tool failures gracefully

This guide demonstrates how to make agents truly useful by connecting them to external systems and capabilities.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Tool registry entries and function definitions
- Agent tool configuration and wildcards
- Tool calling protocols and message formats
- Function.lua implementations for tools
- Integration with external APIs and databases
- Tool error handling and fallback strategies
