**Purpose:** Learn how to extend agent capabilities through tool integration, including tool definition, execution patterns, and building tool ecosystems.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Tool Architecture** - How tools integrate with agents and LLMs
2. **Tool Definition** - Creating tools as registry entries
3. **Tool Discovery** - How agents find and access available tools
4. **Execution Patterns** - Tool calling, parameter handling, and responses
5. **Error Handling** - Managing tool failures and edge cases
6. **Tool Composition** - Building complex capabilities from simple tools
7. **Best Practices** - Design principles for effective tools

## Implementation Notes

- Show tool registry entry structure and configuration
- Demonstrate tool calling flow from LLM through agent to tool
- Include parameter validation and error handling patterns
- Provide tool development templates and examples
- Show tool testing strategies and mock implementations
- Include performance considerations for tool execution
- Provide security guidelines for tool access and permissions
