<!-- Metadata -->
<!-- 
Topic: Agent System Design
Type: Conceptual Guide
Audience: Developers building AI agents
Estimated Reading Time: 20 minutes
Prerequisites: Understanding of actor model and LLMs

-->

**Purpose:** Understand how Wippy agents integrate with the actor model, their internal architecture, and how configuration drives agent behavior and capabilities.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Agent as Actor** - How agents operate within actor model processes
2. **Configuration Structure** - YAML-based agent definitions and metadata
3. **Runtime Architecture** - Agent lifecycle and message processing
4. **LLM Integration** - Connection to language model providers
5. **System Message Construction** - How prompts, traits, and memory combine
6. **Tool Execution** - Agent capability extension through tools
7. **State Management** - Conversation context and agent memory

## Implementation Notes

- Show agent registry entry structure and required fields
- Explain how agents inherit from base actor functionality
- Demonstrate agent spawning and lifecycle management
- Include LLM provider configuration and connection handling
- Show system message assembly from multiple sources
- Provide tool integration architecture and execution flow
- Include debugging techniques for agent behavior and responses
