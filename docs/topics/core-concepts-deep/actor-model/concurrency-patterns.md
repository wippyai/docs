**Purpose:** Master common concurrency patterns in actor model systems, including request-response, work distribution, event handling, and coordination patterns.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Request-Response Pattern** - Synchronous-style communication in async system
2. **Work Distribution** - Load balancing and worker pool management
3. **Event Handling** - Publish-subscribe and event-driven architectures
4. **State Management** - Coordinated state across multiple processes
5. **Resource Pooling** - Managing shared resources and connections
6. **Pipeline Processing** - Sequential and parallel processing pipelines
7. **Coordination Patterns** - Barriers, rendezvous, and synchronization

## Implementation Notes

- Provide complete working examples for each pattern
- Show performance characteristics and trade-offs
- Include error handling and failure recovery for each pattern
- Demonstrate testing strategies for concurrent patterns
- Show how patterns compose and interact
- Include anti-patterns and common mistakes to avoid
- Provide metrics and monitoring approaches for each pattern
