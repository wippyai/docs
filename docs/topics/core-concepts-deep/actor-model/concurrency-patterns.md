## Purpose

Explore common concurrency patterns in Wippy including request-response, work distribution, event handling, and resource pooling.

## Plan

1. **Request-Response** - Synchronous-style communication with async implementation
2. **Work Distribution** - Load balancing across worker processes
3. **Event Handling** - Pub-sub patterns and event-driven architecture
4. **Resource Pooling** - Managing shared resources safely
5. **Pipeline Processing** - Chaining processes for data transformation

This guide demonstrates proven patterns for building concurrent applications using Wippy's actor model.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Request-response with reply_to addressing
- Worker pool management and task distribution
- Event bus patterns with process.events()
- Resource manager processes and access control
- Pipeline architectures with process chaining
