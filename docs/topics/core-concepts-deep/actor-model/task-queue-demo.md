**Purpose:** Build a complete task queue system that demonstrates actor model principles including work distribution, supervision, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## Plan

This tutorial will cover:

1. **System Architecture** - Design overview and component relationships
2. **Task Producer** - Process for generating and queueing work
3. **Worker Pool** - Scalable worker processes for task execution
4. **Supervisor Design** - Fault tolerance and worker management
5. **Load Balancing** - Distributing work efficiently across workers
6. **Monitoring & Metrics** - Tracking system performance and health
7. **Scaling Strategies** - Adding/removing workers dynamically

## Implementation Notes

- Create complete working task queue with multiple components
- Implement producer process that generates tasks at configurable rate
- Build worker processes that execute tasks with realistic processing time
- Design supervisor that manages worker lifecycle and handles failures
- Include load balancer that distributes work optimally
- Add monitoring process that tracks metrics and system health
- Provide testing framework for verifying system behavior under load
- Include configuration examples for different deployment scenarios
