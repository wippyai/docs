# Demo: Task Queue System

<!--
TOC: Core Concepts > Actor Model in Wippy > Demo: Task Queue System
Audience: Developers new to actor model
Duration: 45 minutes
Prerequisites: Concurrency Patterns understanding
-->

## Purpose

Build a complete task queue system that demonstrates all actor model concepts including supervision, work distribution, and fault tolerance.

## Plan

1. **Architecture design** - Queue manager, workers, and supervisor hierarchy
2. **Queue manager process** - Task distribution and worker coordination
3. **Worker processes** - Task execution with failure handling
4. **Supervisor implementation** - Worker restart and monitoring
5. **Testing and monitoring** - Validate system behavior under load

This hands-on demo consolidates actor model learning by building a realistic concurrent system.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Multi-process architecture with clear responsibilities
- Message-based task distribution patterns
- Worker pool management with dynamic scaling
- Supervision tree with restart strategies
- Error handling and system resilience
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
