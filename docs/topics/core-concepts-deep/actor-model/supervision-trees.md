**Purpose:** Learn how to build fault-tolerant systems using Wippy's supervision mechanisms, process linking, monitoring, and recovery strategies.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Supervision Concepts** - Philosophy of "let it crash" and recovery
2. **Process Linking** - Bidirectional failure propagation
3. **Process Monitoring** - Unidirectional failure notification
4. **Supervisor Patterns** - One-for-one, one-for-all, and custom strategies
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and recovery procedures
6. **System Events** - Handling EXIT, CANCEL, and LINK_DOWN events
7. **Best Practices** - Building resilient supervision hierarchies

## Implementation Notes

- Demonstrate process.link() vs process.monitor() behaviors
- Show spawn_linked() and spawn_monitored() usage patterns
- Include supervisor process implementation examples
- Explain trap_links option for graceful error handling
- Provide recovery strategy patterns and decision trees
- Show system event handling with process.events()
- Include testing strategies for fault tolerance scenarios
