## Purpose

Learn how to manage component dependencies, lifecycle ordering, and complex relationships in Wippy applications.

## Plan

1. **Dependency types** - Hard dependencies vs. soft references
2. **Lifecycle management** - Startup and shutdown ordering
3. **Circular dependencies** - Detection and resolution
4. **Dynamic dependencies** - Runtime component discovery
5. **Health checking** - Ensuring dependency availability

This guide explains how to build complex applications with properly managed component relationships.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- depends_on metadata and lifecycle configuration
- Component startup and shutdown ordering
- Circular dependency detection and resolution
- Dynamic component registration and discovery
- Health checking and dependency monitoring
- Error handling for missing dependencies
