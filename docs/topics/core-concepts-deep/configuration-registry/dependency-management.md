**Purpose:** Master component dependency management including lifecycle ordering, circular dependency detection, and strategies for building reliable application startup sequences.

## Plan

This guide will cover:

1. **Dependency Concepts** - Why dependencies matter and common patterns
2. **Explicit Dependencies** - Declaring component relationships
3. **Lifecycle Management** - Startup ordering and shutdown sequences
4. **Circular Dependencies** - Detection and resolution strategies
5. **Conditional Dependencies** - Optional and environment-specific dependencies
6. **Dependency Injection** - Providing dependencies to components
7. **Troubleshooting** - Debugging dependency issues and failures

## Implementation Notes

- Show dependency declaration syntax in component configurations
- Demonstrate dependency resolution algorithms and ordering
- Include lifecycle management with auto_start and depends_on
- Provide circular dependency detection and resolution examples
- Show conditional dependency patterns for different environments
- Include dependency injection patterns for loose coupling
- Provide debugging tools and techniques for dependency problems
