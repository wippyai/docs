**Purpose:** Master Wippy's configuration-driven architecture including registry system, YAML configuration, component types, and dependency management for building maintainable applications.

## Plan

This section will cover:

1. **Registry Architecture** - Centralized component configuration and discovery
2. **YAML Configuration** - Structure, syntax, and best practices
3. **Component Types** - Different kinds of registry entries and their purposes
4. **Dependency Management** - Component relationships and startup ordering
5. **Environment Integration** - Configuration for different deployment contexts
6. **Validation & Debugging** - Ensuring configuration correctness
7. **Advanced Patterns** - Configuration composition and template strategies

## Implementation Notes

- Explain registry as central nervous system of Wippy applications
- Show configuration file organization and namespace strategies
- Demonstrate all major component types with practical examples
- Include dependency resolution algorithms and conflict handling
- Provide environment-specific configuration patterns
- Show configuration validation tools and debugging techniques
- Include configuration testing and maintenance strategies
