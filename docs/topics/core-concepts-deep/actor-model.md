**Purpose:** Provide comprehensive understanding of how Wippy implements the Actor Model, enabling developers to build robust concurrent applications with proper process design and supervision.

## Plan

This section will cover:

1. **Actor Model Fundamentals** - Theory and principles
2. **Wippy's Implementation** - How Go runtime executes Lua processes
3. **Process Architecture** - PIDs, lifecycle, and isolation
4. **Message Passing Mechanics** - Topics, channels, and communication patterns
5. **Supervision Strategies** - Fault tolerance and recovery
6. **Concurrency Patterns** - Common designs for concurrent processing
7. **Practical Application** - Complete task queue system demonstration

## Implementation Notes

- Compare Wippy's actor model with Erlang/OTP and Akka implementations
- Include performance characteristics and scalability considerations
- Provide debugging techniques specific to actor model applications
- Show how actor model solves common concurrency problems
- Include anti-patterns and common mistakes to avoid
- Demonstrate testing strategies for concurrent systems
- Connect concepts to real-world distributed system challenges
