**Purpose:** Master Wippy's AI Agents framework including agent architecture, prompt engineering, tool integration, and memory management for building sophisticated AI-powered applications.

## Plan

This section will cover:

1. **Agent Architecture** - How agents integrate with actor model processes
2. **Configuration-Driven Design** - YAML-based agent definition and composition
3. **Prompt Engineering** - System message construction and trait composition
4. **Tool Integration** - Extending agents with custom capabilities
5. **Memory Management** - Context handling and conversation state
6. **Agent Composition** - Inheritance, delegation, and specialization
7. **Practical Application** - Complete customer support bot demonstration

## Implementation Notes

- Compare Wippy agents with other AI agent frameworks
- Show how agents leverage actor model for scalability and fault tolerance
- Demonstrate LLM provider integration and configuration
- Include performance optimization techniques for agent interactions
- Provide debugging strategies specific to AI agent behavior
- Show testing approaches for non-deterministic agent responses
- Include best practices for prompt engineering and tool design
