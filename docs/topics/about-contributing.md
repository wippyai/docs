# Contributing

Wippy is developed by [Spiral Scout](https://spiralscout.com). We use it in production for internal systems and client projects. The public release is in alpha.

## Stability

- **Lua API**: Stable
- **External behavior**: Stable
- **Registry entry definitions**: Stable, with minor exceptions. Migration path provided if changes required.
- **Internal runtime APIs**: May change
- **Lower-level mechanics**: May change

## Pull Requests

We accept pull requests for Lua module improvements, API stabilization, and documentation.

We're not accepting pull requests for high-level architectural changes or core design decisions. We need to maintain control over the main direction during this phase.

Issues and feedback are always welcome.

## Other Projects

Spiral Scout maintains several open source projects including [RoadRunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner), [Spiral Framework](https://github.com/spiral/framework), and [Cycle ORM](https://github.com/cycle/orm).
