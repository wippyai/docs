## Purpose

Learn how to distribute processes across multiple nodes in a Wippy cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.

## Plan

1. **Node architecture** - Multi-node cluster design and communication
2. **Process placement** - Strategies for distributing processes across nodes
3. **Node discovery** - Dynamic node registration and health management
4. **Load balancing** - Distributing work across available nodes
5. **Network partitions** - Handling split-brain and network failures

This guide shows how to build scalable distributed systems with Wippy's actor model.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Multi-node Wippy cluster configuration
- Process host distribution strategies
- Node discovery and cluster membership
- Load balancing algorithms for process placement
- Network partition handling and recovery
- Inter-node communication patterns
