## Purpose

Learn advanced scaling patterns for Wippy applications including horizontal scaling, load balancing, and resource management.

## Plan

1. **Horizontal scaling** - Adding nodes and distributing load
2. **Auto-scaling** - Dynamic scaling based on demand
3. **Resource management** - CPU, memory, and network optimization
4. **Load balancing** - Distributing work efficiently across nodes
5. **Performance monitoring** - Metrics and observability for scaling decisions

This guide shows how to build systems that can scale from single node to large clusters automatically.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Horizontal scaling strategies and node provisioning
- Auto-scaling triggers and policies
- Resource monitoring and allocation
- Load balancing algorithms and implementations
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Capacity planning and cost optimization
