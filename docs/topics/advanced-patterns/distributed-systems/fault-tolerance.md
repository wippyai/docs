## Purpose

Implement comprehensive fault tolerance strategies for distributed Wippy systems including supervision, recovery, and graceful degradation.

## Plan

1. **Failure modes** - Understanding and categorizing system failures
2. **Supervision strategies** - Multi-level supervision in distributed systems
3. **Recovery patterns** - Automatic recovery and state reconstruction
4. **Circuit breakers** - Preventing cascade failures
5. **Graceful degradation** - Maintaining service during partial failures

This guide demonstrates how to build resilient distributed systems that handle failures gracefully.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Distributed supervision tree architectures
- Node failure detection and recovery
- Process migration and state reconstruction
- Circuit breaker implementation patterns
- Service degradation strategies
- Chaos engineering and failure testing
