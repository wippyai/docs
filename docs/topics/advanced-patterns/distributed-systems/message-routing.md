## Purpose

Master message routing in distributed Wippy systems including cross-node communication, routing strategies, and network optimization.

## Plan

1. **Routing architecture** - Message routing between nodes
2. **Delivery guarantees** - At-least-once, at-most-once, exactly-once semantics
3. **Network optimization** - Reducing latency and bandwidth usage
4. **Routing strategies** - Consistent hashing, proximity-based routing
5. **Failure handling** - Dead letter queues and retry mechanisms

This guide covers the networking layer that enables distributed actor model systems.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Cross-node message routing protocols
- Message delivery guarantee implementations
- Network topology optimization
- Routing table management and updates
- Message batching and compression
- Failure detection and recovery mechanisms
