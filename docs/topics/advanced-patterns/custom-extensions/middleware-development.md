## Purpose

Learn how to develop custom middleware for HTTP request processing and message interception in Wippy applications.

## Plan

1. **Middleware architecture** - Request/response interception patterns
2. **HTTP middleware** - Custom request processing and authentication
3. **Message middleware** - Intercepting and transforming messages
4. **Chain composition** - Ordering and combining middleware
5. **Performance considerations** - Efficient middleware implementation

This guide shows how to extend Wippy's processing pipeline with custom middleware.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- HTTP middleware interface and implementation
- Message interception and transformation
- Middleware chain composition and ordering
- Configuration and dependency injection
- Error handling and bypass mechanisms
- Performance optimization and caching
