## Purpose

Learn how to create new registry component types that integrate with Wippy's configuration system and lifecycle management.

## Plan

1. **Component architecture** - Registry integration and lifecycle hooks
2. **Configuration schema** - Defining component configuration structure
3. **Lifecycle management** - Start, stop, and dependency handling
4. **Component factories** - Creating instances from configuration
5. **Extension points** - Hooks for customization and monitoring

This guide demonstrates how to extend Wippy's component system with new types.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Component interface implementation
- Configuration validation and parsing
- Lifecycle hook implementation
- Component factory patterns
- Registry integration and metadata
- Extension point design and implementation
