## Purpose

Optimize Wippy applications for production performance including profiling, tuning, and resource management.

## Plan

1. **Performance profiling** - Identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
2. **Resource tuning** - CPU, memory, and network optimization
3. **Caching strategies** - Application and infrastructure caching
4. **Load balancing** - Traffic distribution and scaling
5. **Capacity planning** - Predicting and planning for growth

This guide shows how to maximize performance and efficiency of Wippy applications in production.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Performance profiling tools and techniques
- Go runtime tuning and optimization
- Caching strategies at multiple layers
- Load balancer configuration and optimization
- Capacity planning and resource allocation
- Performance testing and benchmarking
