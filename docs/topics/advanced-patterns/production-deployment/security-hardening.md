## Purpose

Secure Wippy applications for production deployment with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and network security measures.

## Plan

1. **Authentication strategies** - Multi-factor auth and SSO integration
2. **Authorization policies** - Role-based access control and permissions
3. **Network security** - TLS, firewalls, and network segmentation
4. **Secure coding** - Input validation and injection prevention
5. **Security monitoring** - Threat detection and incident response

This guide demonstrates how to build and deploy secure Wippy applications.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Authentication middleware and SSO integration
- Authorization policy implementation
- TLS configuration and certificate management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security scanning and vulnerability management
- Incident response and security monitoring
