## Purpose

Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability for Wippy applications in production environments.

## Plan

1. **Metrics collection** - Application and system metrics
2. **Logging strategy** - Structured logging and log aggregation
3. **Health checks** - Service health monitoring and alerting
4. **Distributed tracing** - Request flow across processes and services
5. **Alerting and dashboards** - Proactive monitoring and visualization

This guide covers building observable systems that provide insight into application behavior and performance.

<!--
Implementation will cover:
- Metrics collection with Prometheus integration
- Structured logging with centralized aggregation
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Distributed tracing across process boundaries
- Alert configuration and escalation policies
- Dashboard design and visualization
