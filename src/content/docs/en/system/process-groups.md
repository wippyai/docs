# Process Groups

Process groups let processes join named groups and receive broadcasts addressed to a group, with membership tracked across every node in the cluster. The model follows Erlang/OTP `pg`: groups are created on first join, a process can belong to many groups (and join one group multiple times), and membership is decentralized — each node maintains its own state and reconciles with peers over the internode mesh.

The Lua API is documented in [Process Groups](lua/core/pg.md); this page covers the scope entry kind and its configuration. See the [Cluster Guide](guides/cluster.md) for the surrounding membership model.

## Entry Kind

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `pg.scope` | An independent process-group namespace with its own membership state and cluster mesh |

Each scope is isolated: groups and members in one scope are invisible to another. A process opens a scope by its entry ID (`pg.open("app:pg")`) and operates within it.

```yaml
- name: pg
  kind: pg.scope
  lifecycle:
    auto_start: true
```

## Configuration

All fields are optional and have defaults tuned for a typical cluster.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `protocol_timeout` | duration | 5s | Timeout for inter-node sync/discover operations |
| `broadcast_timeout` | duration | 5s | Timeout for delivering a broadcast to a single member |
| `anti_entropy_interval` | duration | 30s | Cadence of the reconcile loop; one peer is synced per tick (0 disables) |
| `circuit_breaker_failures` | int | 3 | Consecutive send failures to a node before its circuit opens |
| `circuit_breaker_reset_time` | duration | 10s | Wait before an open circuit moves to half-open for a test send |
| `max_retries` | int | 3 | Retry attempts for a failed broadcast (0 disables retries) |
| `retry_base_delay` | duration | 100ms | Initial backoff delay between retries |
| `retry_max_delay` | duration | 1s | Maximum backoff delay |
| `action_queue_size` | int | 256 | Depth at which an "approaching capacity" warning is logged |
| `action_queue_max_size` | int | 1024 | Hard capacity of the internal event-loop queue; operations are dropped when full |
| `monitor_buffer` | int | 64 | Per-subscription event channel capacity; events drop for a subscriber whose buffer fills |
| `max_groups` | int | 0 | Maximum distinct groups (0 = unlimited) |
| `max_members_per_group` | int | 0 | Maximum members per group, counting multi-joins (0 = unlimited) |

```yaml
- name: pg
  kind: pg.scope
  anti_entropy_interval: 30s
  circuit_breaker_failures: 3
  max_members_per_group: 10000
  lifecycle:
    auto_start: true
```

## How It Works

**Single-writer state.** Each scope runs a single-goroutine event loop (the gen_server pattern). All mutations are serialized through it; reads of members and groups are served from atomically-published snapshots, so they never block the loop.

**Join/leave propagation.** A local join or leave is applied to the loop and then fanned out to the union of the live membership peers and any previously-discovered remote nodes. Sending to that union ensures a freshly joined or not-yet-converged node still receives the change.

**Broadcast.** `broadcast` snapshots the full cross-cluster member list inside the loop, then delivers to each member outside the loop so a slow recipient cannot stall the scope. `broadcast_local` does the same but only for members on the local node.

**Monitor and events.** Subscribing and snapshotting the current members happen in one event-loop tick, so a subscriber never misses or double-counts a change that races the subscription. Subscribers receive `member.joined` / `member.left` events; a leave for a process that joined N times reports the PID N times, preserving multiplicity.

**Anti-entropy and discovery.** On start, a scope sends discover messages to a small random subset of peers (capped to avoid an N² storm when many nodes restart at once). When a node joins, it receives a full state sync. The anti-entropy loop then periodically pushes a full sync to one peer at a time, so any broadcast a peer missed eventually converges. The receiver applies a differential sync — only members actually added or removed emit events.

**Circuit breakers.** A per-node circuit breaker tracks consecutive send failures. After `circuit_breaker_failures` failures it opens and sends to that node are skipped until `circuit_breaker_reset_time` elapses, when one test send is allowed. Join/leave broadcasts that hit an open breaker are retried with exponential backoff up to `max_retries`.

## Observability

A liveness health check (`pg.broadcast_recent.<scope>`) reports unhealthy if a scope sees no broadcast traffic for an extended period, surfacing a wedged event loop or a persistent partition. See the [Observability Guide](guides/observability.md).
