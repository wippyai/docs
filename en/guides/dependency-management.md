# Dependency Management

Wippy uses a lock file-based dependency system. Modules are published to the hub, declared as dependencies in your source, and resolved into a `wippy.lock` file that tracks exact versions.

## Project Files

### wippy.lock

The lock file tracks your project's directory layout and pinned dependencies:

```yaml
directories:
  modules: .wippy
  src: ./src
modules:
  - name: acme/http
    version: v1.2.0
    hash: 4ea816fe84ca58a1f0869e5ca6afa93d6ddd72fa09e1162d9e600a7fbf39f0a2
  - name: acme/sql
    version: v2.0.1
    hash: b3f9c8e12a456d7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `directories.modules` | Where downloaded modules are stored (default: `.wippy`) |
| `directories.src` | Where your source code lives (default: `./src`) |
| `modules[].name` | Module identifier in `org/module` format |
| `modules[].version` | Pinned semantic version |
| `modules[].hash` | Artifact digest the downloaded pack must match; a bare hex value is read as `sha256` |
| `modules[].root` | Marks the selected deployment root; at most one module may carry it |
| `options.unpack_modules` | Extract packs into directories instead of loading them as `.wapp` files (default: `false`) |

### wippy.yaml

Module metadata for publishing. Required only when you publish your own module:

```yaml
organization: acme
module: http
version: 1.2.0
description: HTTP utilities for Wippy
license: MIT
repository: https://github.com/acme/wippy-http
keywords:
  - http
  - web
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `organization` | Yes | Lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens |
| `module` | Yes | Lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens |
| `version` | No | Semantic version (set at publish time) |
| `description` | No | Module description |
| `license` | No | SPDX license identifier |
| `repository` | No | Source repository URL |
| `homepage` | No | Project homepage |
| `keywords` | No | Discovery keywords |
| `authors` | No | Author list |

## Declaring Dependencies

Add `ns.dependency` entries in your `_index.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
namespace: app
entries:
  - name: dependency.http
    kind: ns.dependency
    component: acme/http
    version: "^1.0.0"

  - name: dependency.sql
    kind: ns.dependency
    component: acme/sql
    version: ">=2.0.0"
```

### Version Constraints

| Constraint | Example | Matches |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Exact | `1.2.3` | Only 1.2.3 |
| Caret | `^1.2.0` | >=1.2.0, <2.0.0 |
| Tilde | `~1.2.0` | >=1.2.0, <1.3.0 |
| Range | `>=1.0.0` | 1.0.0 and above |
| Wildcard | `*` | Any version (picks highest) |
| Combined | `>=1.0.0 <2.0.0` | Between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 |

### Resolution Rules

- Each module resolves against the **intersection of all declared ranges** across the dependency graph. Incompatible ranges (diamond conflicts) fail resolution with an explicit error rather than silently picking one side.
- A full `wippy update` solves every module from its declared ranges; a targeted update and boot-time repair keep a pinned version that still satisfies every live range.
- **Root parameters win over transitive ones**: when your app and a dependency both bind the same requirement, the parameters on your `ns.dependency` take precedence. Version ranges are never overridden; every declaration joins the intersection.
- A component declared by several root `ns.dependency` entries is controlled by one of them — established declarations before new ones, parameter carriers before plain ones, ties on the lowest entry ID — and the others fold into references to it. A duplicate whose parameters disagree with the controlling declaration is rejected with a conflict error; update the existing dependency instead.

Two resolution failures are reported distinctly. A constraint expression that cannot be satisfied by any release ever — the intersection of live ranges is empty — is a conflict, and the error names the module and every requester that contributed a range. A valid range set for which the hub currently publishes no matching version is an availability failure instead: a later release can make it resolvable without any change to the declarations.

The runtime persists each resolved graph in its registry history and replays it at boot instead of re-solving, so a deployed application boots with exactly the versions that were resolved when the dependency change was applied. `wippy.lock` remains the portable snapshot for source projects.

### Entry provenance

Provenance is registry-owned, not entry metadata. When entries are loaded, the registry stamps each one with the deployment source that supplied it:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `registry.owner` | Module name (`org/module`) that supplied the entry; empty for application source |
| `registry.root` | Set on `ns.dependency` entries supplied by the deployment root, marking them as root declarations |

Entry authors never write these fields; they are assigned during loading and cannot be forged from an `_index.yaml`. Inspect them with `wippy registry list --registry-meta --json`.

## Workflow

### Starting a New Project

```bash
wippy init
```

Creates a `wippy.lock` with default directories.

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
wippy add acme/http               # Latest version
wippy add acme/http@1.2.3         # Exact version
wippy add acme/http@latest         # Latest label
```

This updates the lock file. Then install:

```bash
wippy install
```

### Resolving from Source

If your source already declares `ns.dependency` entries:

```bash
wippy update
```

This scans your source directory, resolves all dependency constraints, updates the lock file, and installs modules.

### Updating Dependencies

```bash
wippy update                       # Re-resolve all dependencies
wippy update acme/http             # Update only acme/http
wippy update acme/http acme/sql    # Update specific modules
```

When updating specific modules, other modules stay pinned to their current versions. If the update would require changing non-target modules, you are prompted for confirmation.

### Installing from Lock File

```bash
wippy install                      # Install all from lock
wippy install --refresh            # Re-fetch every module (--force and --repair are aliases)
```

## Module Storage

Downloaded modules are stored under the `.wippy/vendor/` directory:

```
project/
  wippy.lock
  src/
    _index.yaml
  .wippy/
    vendor/
      acme/
        http-v1.2.0.wapp
        sql-v2.0.1.wapp
```

By default, modules are kept as `.wapp` files. To extract them into directories:

```yaml
# wippy.lock
options:
  unpack_modules: true
```

With unpacking enabled:

```
.wippy/
  vendor/
    acme/
      http-v1.2.0.wapp
      http/
        wippy.yaml
        src/
          _index.yaml
          ...
```

Unpacking never discards the pack. The canonical verified `.wapp` stays beside the extracted directory because it is the only content-addressed evidence for the module, and artifact materialization and repair read resources back out of it. The `.wapp` is what installation checks for: a directory whose pack is missing counts as not installed, and the module is downloaded again. Each install extracts the directory afresh from the verified archive, so hand-edits to a vendored directory do not survive.

Modules resolved from a [workspace replacement](#local-development-with-replacements) are never downloaded or vendored; they load from the local path.

## Local Development with Replacements

Override hub modules with local directories for development. Replacements are declared in the `workspace` section of a runtime config file — typically a private, git-ignored one composed on top of `.wippy.yaml`:

```yaml
# .wippy.workspace.yaml
version: "1.0"
workspace:
  replacements:
    acme/http: ../local-http
    acme/sql: ../local-sql
```

```bash
wippy run --config .wippy.yaml --config .wippy.workspace.yaml
```

Keys are `org/module`, values are directories (relative paths resolve against the first `--config` file's directory). Setting a replacement to `null` disables one inherited from an earlier config layer or profile. Replacements can also live inside a [profile](guides/configuration.md#profiles) so they activate only with `--profile workspace`.

The path is required to exist, and to be a directory, only for a module the lock graph actually selects. A replacement declared for a module that nothing depends on is a resolution input, not a boot input: it can point at a directory that is not checked out on this machine without failing validation.

A replacement changes where a module's source comes from, not which release was chosen. The load path keeps the version and digest the lock selected for that module and is flagged as a replacement; entries loaded from it shadow the vendored ones with the same ID. When a replacement is declared for a module the lock does not pin a version for, resolution asks the hub for a release version, and until stronger evidence selects one it holds a local-only zero version.

Workspace replacements affect the load graph at boot and are never written to `wippy.lock`. Changes to the local source are reconciled directly, without contacting the hub. The module's source `exclude:` globs from `wippy.yaml` apply to replacement directories too, both when loading entries and when hashing content.

A `replacements:` section in `wippy.lock` is deprecated: it still loads but prints a warning. Move those entries to `workspace.replacements` in a config file.

## Load Order

At boot, Wippy loads entries from directories in this order:

1. Source directory (`src`)
2. Replacement directories
3. Vendored module directories

Modules with active replacements skip their vendor path.

## Integrity Verification

Every module in the lock file carries an artifact digest. Boot refuses to load a module whose lock entry has none; `wippy install` accepts such an entry and records the digest the hub serves with the download.

At boot, downloads are staged: the pack is written to a temporary file next to its final location, verified against both the digest pinned in `wippy.lock` and the digest the hub served with the download URL (plus the served size), and only then renamed into place. A staged file that fails verification is deleted. `wippy install` renames the download into its vendor path before verifying it, checks it against the served digest and size only, deletes it on failure, and replaces a lock digest that differs from the served one rather than enforcing it.

A digest mismatch is a hard, non-retryable failure. At boot it is `PermissionDenied`, "module integrity verification failed", raised for a fresh download and for an already-vendored pack, which is re-verified against the lock digest before entries are loaded. `wippy install` reports it as `Internal`: "failed to store module" wrapping "verify cached WAPP: digest mismatch" for a pack already in the vendor directory, and "failed to download module" wrapping "verify downloaded WAPP: digest mismatch" for a fresh download. Nothing retries, re-downloads over the mismatch, or falls back to the served content.

The same check guards resolution. When the hub serves a manifest whose digest differs from the one the lock pins, the manifest cache is refreshed once and re-compared; if it still disagrees, resolution fails naming both digests.

Extracted directories carry their own recorded digest, size, and tree digest, and are re-verified against the recorded values, so a modified vendored tree is detected rather than loaded.

Replacement sources are content-addressed too. The runtime digests the replacement tree and rejects it when the resolved graph already pins a different digest or size for that module, so a replacement cannot silently stand in for content it does not match.

## Build-time Artifacts

A module can ship a filesystem resource marked with `meta.artifact.format` that consumers materialize onto disk instead of reading at runtime. Full and targeted `wippy install` and `wippy update`, cold boot, and runtime dependency operations reconcile those outputs as part of the same transaction that changes the module graph; `artifact.materialization_root` sets the output root.
