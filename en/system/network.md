# Network Overlays

Network overlay entries route outbound connections or bind listeners through SOCKS5, Tor, Tailscale, or I2P. A selected overlay propagates across function, process, and HTTP boundaries.

## Entry Kinds

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `network.socks5` | Generic SOCKS5 proxy (also covers Tor's SOCKS5 listener) |
| `network.tailscale` | Tailscale tsnet overlay node |
| `network.i2p` | I2P SAM v3 bridge |

## SOCKS5

```yaml
- name: proxy
  kind: network.socks5
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 1080
  username: "optional"
  password: "optional"
  isolate_streams: false
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `host` | string | Proxy host |
| `port` | int | Proxy port (1-65535) |
| `username` | string | Optional SOCKS5 auth |
| `password` | string | Optional SOCKS5 auth |
| `isolate_streams` | bool | Per-connection random credentials (Tor stream isolation) |

`host` and `port` are required. `isolate_streams` defaults to `false`. When
isolation is enabled, the runtime generates a new username and password for
each dial instead of using the configured credentials.

## Tailscale

```yaml
- name: tailnet
  kind: network.tailscale
  hostname: "wippy-node"
  auth_key: ${env:TS_AUTHKEY}
  ephemeral: false
  control_url: ""
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `hostname` | string | tsnet node name (used in per-node state directory) |
| `auth_key` | string | Tailnet auth key — inline or `${env:NAME}` resolved via the [env registry](./env.md) |
| `state_dir` | string | Override for tsnet state directory |
| `control_url` | string | Alternate coordination server |
| `ephemeral` | bool | Register as an ephemeral tailnet node |

`auth_key` is required (supply it directly or via `${env:NAME}`). The legacy `auth_key_env` directive resolves the same way but is deprecated; prefer `auth_key: ${env:NAME}`.

The tsnet hostname defaults to `wippy`. When `state_dir` is omitted, the runtime
uses `<network_service.state_dir>/tailscale/<node>`, where `<node>` is the
configured hostname or, if no hostname is configured, the registry entry name.

## I2P

```yaml
- name: i2p_bridge
  kind: network.i2p
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 7656
  session_name: "wippy"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `host` | string | SAM v3 bridge host |
| `port` | int | SAM v3 bridge port |
| `session_name` | string | Optional session identifier |

`host` and `port` are required. `session_name` defaults to `wippy` and is used
as the prefix for per-dial and per-listener SAM session IDs.

## Selecting an Overlay

### On `http.service`

Bind the server listener through an overlay (Tailscale, I2P):

```yaml
- name: gateway
  kind: http.service
  addr: ":8080"
  network: app.net:tailnet
```

SOCKS5 does not support inbound listening — use it only for outbound dials.

### From Lua

Route a called function or spawned process through an overlay using `with_options`:

```lua
local funcs = require("funcs")

local result, err = funcs.new()
    :with_options({ network = "app.net:proxy" })
    :call("app.api:fetch_data")
```

```lua
local process = require("process")

local pid, err = process.with_options({ network = "app.net:tailnet" })
    :spawn_monitored("app.workers:probe", "app:processes")
```

The `http_client` module accepts the same overlay selection on per-call options under the key `overlay_network`.

## Inheritance

Overlay selection propagates through the call stack. A function called through
`funcs.new():with_options({network=...})` uses the overlay for inner dials,
nested calls, and spawned processes unless a new boundary selects another
overlay. An empty `network` option means "no override"; it does not clear an
inherited overlay or the application default.

For a function call, runtime options override the function entry's
`meta.options` before network selection. At a new function or process boundary,
a non-empty `options.network` is selected first. If it is absent,
`network_service.default_network` is selected when configured; if neither is
present, the inherited frame selection remains. A selected ID must already be
registered. An unknown ID fails the call or spawn instead of falling back to
the host network.

Ambient inheritance bypasses the descendant's own `network.select` deny rules. Only explicit selection at a Lua edge is gated.

## App Configuration

Overlay drivers read app-wide settings from a `network_service:` block in `.wippy.yaml`:

```yaml
network_service:
  state_dir: .wippy/net          # base dir for driver state (Tailscale keys, etc.)
  default_network: app.net:tailnet  # overlay applied when no call sets one
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `state_dir` | `.wippy/net` | Driver state directory. Relative paths resolve against the boot config dir. |
| `default_network` | — | Registry ID of an overlay applied to any task or process that does not pin its own network via options. |

## Updating Overlays

Overlay entries are replaced on registry update. The driver builds the replacement before switching to it; if creation fails, the existing overlay continues running. A successful swap is atomic for new lookups, then the previous service is closed. Work already using the previous service can therefore observe that closure.

## Permissions

| Action | Resource | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `network.select` | Network registry ID | Explicit overlay selection at `funcs.call`, `process.spawn`, `http_client` |
| `network.bind` | Network registry ID | Binding an `http.service` listener through an overlay (the `network:` field) |

Deny `network.select` on a scope to stop code inside it from choosing an overlay explicitly. Inherited overlays are unaffected — they were authorized at the caller. `network.bind` is checked when a server with a `network:` overlay starts its listener.
